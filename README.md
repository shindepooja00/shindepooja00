## Hello, 𝐈’𝐦 𝐏𝐨𝐨𝐣𝐚, 

Thanks for taking an interest to know about me! 

I am an aspiring AI/ML Engineer/Data Scientist.

After earning my **B.E. in Electronics from Mumbai University**, I began my professional career as a **QA Engineer at Capgemini**, where I gained 3.5 years of experience working with clients like **MUFG** and **NSE**. During this time, I honed my skills in testing, debugging, and gained valuable domain knowledge in **BFS and investment banking**.  

While I enjoyed my time in QA, I often felt like a fish in a small pond, craving bigger challenges and opportunities. That’s when I took a leap of faith, quit my job, and started exploring new horizons.

- 🤖 I discovered **AI and chatbot development**, which sparked my curiosity and led me to build intelligent chatbots using platforms like **Voiceflow** and **Botpress**.  
- 🚀 Over time, I expanded my skill set to include **Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Generative AI, and NLP**, paving the way for exciting opportunities in the AI field.
